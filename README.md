## Features and important information
SolusWSL2 will throw up many [errors](https://i.postimg.cc/wxJKrnqh/Screenshot-2022-02-28-130527.png) while installing packages. This is due to [usysconf](https://github.com/getsolus/usysconf) running post installation triggers. It doesn't affect the normal functioning of SolusWSL2 afaik. @Fubuchi has put together a workaround to stop displaying the errors. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/Fubuchi/SolusWSL-usysconf-fix.git). The patched clr-boot-manager is already included in SolusWSL2.

SolusWSL2 has the following features during the installation stage.
* Increase virtual disk size from the default 256GB
* Create a new user and set the user as default
* Supports systemd natively if you are running wsl v0.67.6 (more details [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/)) and above. For earlier versions of wsl, systemd is supported using diddledani's [one-script-wsl2-systemd](https://github.com/diddledani/one-script-wsl2-systemd). This is done automatically during initial setup.

SolusWSL2 includes a wsl.conf file which only has [section headers](https://i.postimg.cc/MZ4DC1Fw/Screenshot-2022-02-02-071533.png). Users can use this file to configure the distro to their liking. You can read more about wsl.conf and its configuration settings [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config).

## Requirements
* For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
* For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.
* Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2.
* If you are running Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, you can install all components required to run wsl2 with a single command. This will install ubuntu by default. More details are available [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/install-wsl-with-a-single-command-now-available-in-windows-10-version-2004-and-higher/).
	```cmd
	wsl.exe --install
	```
* If you are running Windows 10 lower then version 2004, follow the steps below. For more details, check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) microsoft document.
	* Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux feature.
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
	```
	* Enable Virtual Machine feature
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
	```
	* Download and install the latest Linux kernel update package from [here](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).

## How to install
* Make sure all the steps mentioned under "Requirements" are completed.
* [Download](https://github.com/sileshn/SolusWSL2/releases/latest) installer zip
* Extract all files in zip file to same directory
* Set version 2 as default. Note that this step is required only for manual installation.
  ```dos
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```
* Run Solus.exe to extract rootfs and register to WSL

**Note:**
Exe filename is using the instance name to register. If you rename it you can register with a diffrent name and have multiple installs.

## How to setup
Open Solus.exe and run the following commands.
```dos
passwd
sed -i 's#\# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL#%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL#g' /etc/sudoers
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash <username>
passwd <username>
exit
```
Execute the command below in a windows cmd terminal from the directory where Solus.exe is installed.
```dos
>Solus.exe config --default-user <username>
```

## How to build
#### Prerequisites

Docker, tar, zip, unzip need to be installed.

If you want to build using solus unstable profile, checkout the unstable branch.
```dos
git clone git@gitlab.com:sileshn/SolusWSL2.git
cd SolusWSL2
make

```
Copy the Solus-main.zip file to a safe location and run the command below to clean.
```dos
make clean

```

## How to install & run docker in SolusWSL2 without using docker desktop
Install docker binaries. Note that installing docker from solus repos doesn't work as the latest version in solus is 19.03.14. We need 20.10 versions and above.
```dos
sudo eopkg it -y wget
wget https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-20.10.6.tgz
tar xzvf docker-20.10.6.tgz
sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/

```
You can now delete the downloaded files if needed.
```dos
rm -rf docker
rm docker-20.10.6.tgz

```

To manage docker as a non-root user, create and add user to docker group. 
```dos
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

```
